Very quick commandline wrapper around OpenTypeUtilities.cpp from Chromium, used to
make EOT (Embeddable Open Type) files from TTF (TrueType/OpenType Font) files.
For some reason this is the only file format TTLoadEmbeddedFont() accepts,
which is the what Internet Explorer uses for css @font-face declarations.

I've only tested this on Linux.

EOT: http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/SUBM-EOT-20080305/

Chromium: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/deps/third_party/WebKit/WebCore/platform/graphics/win/OpenTypeUtilities.cpp?view=log&pathrev=7591

Build:

    $ make

Usage:

    $ ./ttf2eot < input.ttf > output.eot

Keywords for anyone having as much pain as me finding a utility to do this on Linux:

    covert eot to ttf
    eot converter
    wtf is an eot file
